# Unit Testing :sunglasses:

## What makes a good test?

1.  Runs fast
2.  Doesn't break often
3.  Easy to read/understand
4.  Good coverage to effort ratio

## What is jest?

-   Jest is a testing framework.

    -   Jest will crawl your directory and look for any `.test.ts(js)` file

        -   Once it finds an executable file it will run its tests

        ```jsx
        test('Some test', () => {
            const a = 'Yo';
            expect(a).toEqual('Yo');
        });
        ```

    -   Provides us with assertion libraries i.e.: `expect(something).toMatch(this)`

#

-   Leverage jest in watch mode
    -   Keep the console running as much as possible while in development
    -   This will help you allow you to develop with confidence
