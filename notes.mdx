-   Once you found the good test strategy: Share it
-   Testing Javascript is really easy, testing UI is extremely hard
    -   With JS you take the function, call the functions, compare it to something you expect

-   Shared test utilities
-   Generation of test templates
-   Lint rules
    -   ruleTester
-   Documentation
